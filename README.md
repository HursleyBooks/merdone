## Preface

By its very nature, data is history, and although generally thought of in an academic or business context, the built in historical signiﬁcance does increase with time. Libraries, archives and computers store data in prescribed ways, and we tend to forget that data can also be locked up in old or ruined buildings and in the ground. For recent events the human memory is a key source, but does require validation. Earlier information has surfaced, and probably will continue to, from the most unlikely places, and at the most unexpected of times, to add yet more colour to an already colourful history of one of England’s most beautiful and ancient parks.

Because Hursley Park has a wide range of historical data available from earth works, standing and ruined buildings, records and artefacts, it has been possible to compile this fascinating account of people who, though many lived long ago, left us a heritage from Which we still beneﬁt today. History is about human interaction with a geographic site over a period of time, and the legacy we have of man’s involvement with Hursley Park is both unique and often inspirational.

With the exception of the chapter on Hursley Park’s gardens, this history of Hursley Park covers the years up to A.D.1958, spanning about four millennia. The enormous period BC. is limited to the physical evidences of human occupation, and sadly the personalities involved are totally lost in the mists of time. In 1958 a survey of the house and grounds showed it would be uneconomic for the owning family to use the house again as a private residence, and so its future as commercial premises was sealed for the next chapter of its history.

After the 1958 survey, the lease of the Park House and the surrounding 100 acres was offered on the commercial market, and IBM took up the offer at the end of that year to temporarily re-house their United Kingdom Laboratories from London. The events since 1958 are, for practical reasons, the subject of a follow—on chronicle.

The ﬁrst edition of Merdone from 1972 proved to be a catalyst for more source material coming to light, and the ensuing years have given the opportunity for more research into events this century and other periods. This edition therefore, is intended to present a more complete and interesting historical perspective.

Unless otherwise stated all the dates are AD.

In revising this history of Hursley Park, the compiler has made every effort to authenticate the information gathered. On doubtful issues, the rule of using the earliest information or what should be the most reliable source of information was applied. Some historical accounts have been omitted because, at the time of writing, little confidence could be attached to their accuracy.
