## Earliest History

Before the development of the Hursley Park
House site (in 1413) the area’s dominance
came from the site of Merdon on which stood,
at various times, a hill fort, a manor and
village, and later a castle. This site is about
0.62 miles (1 km) due north of the present
Park House.

The Merdon Castle site is likely to have been
inhabited from prehistoric times, though food-
questing Palaeolithic man left few obvious
traces of his nomadic existence. Although
Neolithic artefacts are easily overlooked
against a background of abundant natural
ﬂint, two Acheulian (of the Palaeolithic period
in Europe) hand axes were found in the area
in 1969. However, right before our eyes exists
undeniable proof that the Bronze Age ‘Beaker’
folk (immigrants from the continent with their
distinctive beaker pottery) lived here as a
settled community from about 2,000 years BC,
and possibly earlier. Their burial mounds,
round barrows, can be seen today in the park;
these are marked as ‘tumuli’ on Ordnance
Survey maps.

The name Merdon implies a fortiﬁcation of
the ancient Britons, those Celtic inhabitants
who saw the Romans arrive and depart. The
imaginative Celts usually chose both personal
and place names with descriptive aptitude.
‘Mere-dun’ - the ‘fort of the mire’ - could not
have been more opposite, unless it related to
boggy land 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south. The
‘Dun’ part of the name signiﬁes a fortiﬁed
place, though ‘Mer’ (or Mere) is less certain,
probably referring to the meres or mires that
the topography has indicated to have
surrounded much of the cleared upland slopes
at that time. Another possibility is that it is a
later preﬁx (signifying a defended ‘march’ or
boundary), which has supplanted or is a
corruption of an earlier name.

The fort’s position on a chalk hill would not
have let it retain for long any rainwater for a
moat, yet its earthen ramparts and deep ditch
with a thorn and bramble barrier backed up
by stout palings (substantial posts with
pointed tops butted against each other)
provided a good inner line of defence. On the
southern side was the supporting agricultural
land and probably cattle enclosures with
ditches and earth banks with some sort of
paling fence on top, with the mires way
beyond - a useful outer line of defence to deter
invasion on that side of the fort. This was
typical of hill forts of the period. This land on
the southern side was developed into a deer
park of some note by 1500.

The beneﬁts of such a substantial and secure
site would have ensured continuous
habitation for a population of about seventy.
This Iron Age fort enclosed about ten acres
(3.7 hectares), and if size can be related to
importance, then this was a fort of some
signiﬁcance. Its deep ditches backed up by
high earth banks, extending to over 2,500 feet
(760 m) in length, show the investment in
time and effort. Only a proper archaeological
excavation can reveal the original depth of the
ditches and height of the defence banks. The
present day excellence of what are substantial
banks and ditches may be by courtesy of the
builders of the Norman castle, who could have
enhanced this outer Iron Age ring to double
their defences on their more vulnerable sides.

Today these banks are up to 16 feet (5 metres)
in height, and so the question of later
enhancement has to be taken into account.

It is very probable that the site had the
character of a fortiﬁed ‘family-tribe’ farm for
most of the Iron Age period, and may have
retained this through Roman times. Through
the pre-Roman period the dwellings would
have been renovated or rebuilt several times,
and probably included a chief’s house or hall
surrounded by many smaller dwellings. There
would have been grain pits, small barns and
the well, which may have been roofed over.
From the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles it is safe to
assume that the site was both inhabited and
an important fortiﬁed village through the 600
years of Saxon occupation. (Merdon is today
listed as one of the lost villages of Hampshire,
along with neighbouring Silkstead and Farley
Chamberlain.)

How the site developed is debatable, but it
might have been used later as a ready—made
strategic position by the Romans. As the site
has never been excavated, the proof of Roman,
and the extent of Saxon, habitation has yet to
be veriﬁed, although excavation of the site
might not prove very informative, because
construction of the Norman castle (earth
works and buildings) would have obliterated
much of the evidence of earlier occupation.
The only hope of ﬁnding Saxon evidence lies
in the 1.5 acre (0.6 hectares) area between the
Norman earth works and the Iron-Age ring on
the east side of the site, and a narrower strip
on the west side. Within a few miles of the
site there are the remains of Roman villas,
and 0.62 miles (1 km) to the south of Merdon,
the Park House site has yielded some Roman
coins and one signiﬁcant Saxon silver penny,
as tantalising evidence of man’s past
involvement.
