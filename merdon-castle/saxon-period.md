## THE SAXON PERIOD

Exactly when the Saxons came to Merdon is
unknown, probably around the year 500, but
their coming raises the fascinating question:
Was it the then displaced Celts who settled
and created Hursley, or was it the later
Saxons, ousted by the Normans when the
castle was built, who caused Hursley to come
into existence?

From the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles in the year
634, a story starts that had a profound effect
on Merdon, Wessex and ultimately all of
southern England. The Italian missionary
Birinus of Lombardy and his team landed at
Portchester with a commission from Pope
Honorius to carry the Gospel of the ‘White
Christ where before it had not hitherto
penetrated’, and the Odin (Woden)
worshipping West Saxons were a natural
starting point. Birinus must have been a little
surprised to ﬁnd evidences of Christianity
still extant, with small church buildings in
many places, as a Celtic-Roman legacy among
the conquered serfs of their Saxon masters.
But this was a relatively dormant Church,
into which Birinus was sent independent of
Canterbury to inject new life and
commitment, and counter the apathy of the
Archbishop and the very real threat of total
anarchy and havoc already experienced from
pagan forces.

Cynegils, king of the Gewissas, a principal
tribe of the West Saxons, became aware of but
kept well away from Birinus and his team.

The king, already with problems from the
frequent wars and skirmishes with the
neighbouring tribes, did not wish to invite yet
more trouble by upsetting Odin through
associating with anyone who appeared to be
as weak and foolish as Birinus. Also, had not
his daughter’s conversion to Christianity
added to his misfortune? It was known that
Birinus often travelled with few companions,
and lit just one campﬁre at night unlike
‘sensible’ travellers who, with more
companions, lit many campﬁres to appear as a
much larger force to deter opportunist attacks.
When Birinus was challenged about his
apparent folly, his reply was that he only had
one light in his life, and his one ﬁre
represented that one light - Jesus Christ — and
his experience and survival had proved the
sufﬁciency of that one light.

As the year progressed the Church under
Birinus prospered, but the lot of Cynegils did
not, despite invoking Odin’s help. Life was
perilous and uncertain, with crops and homes
under constant threat of pillage and burning,
yet amidst this mayhem there was Birinus
successfully building up the Church.
Eventually the two men met; how or where is
not known, but their meeting had a dramatic
effect on both Cynegils and eventually the
whole country. Cynegils accepted the new
faith with its changes so diametrically
opposite to his old life style, and peace came
to the warring tribes, creating the stable
society that was to be such a blessing to
Alfred the Great two and a half centuries
later.

For the year 635, the Anglo Saxon Chronicles
record the conversion to Christianity of
Cynegils, and Birinus baptising him. As a

testimony of his new faith in Jesus Christ,
Cynegils gave the heart of his kingdom to God
with his gift of lands to the Bishop and
Church in Winchester just over a year later.
This grant included all the lands within a
seven mile radius circle of Winchester. The
indirect result was that the Bishop and
Church in Winchester had such political and
monetary strength, that Winchester became
the richest bishopric in all England. The See’s
inﬂuence extended and increased far beyond
the present boundaries of Hampshire,
evidenced by the many ‘Domum Deeds’ and
place names that still exist today. (Domum -
Latin for home).

From this grant in 637, the ownership of
these fertile lands remained with the See of
Winchester for 915 years, inﬂuencing both
the size and character of the city to the
present day. This seven-mile radius of
Winchester took in Hursley Park, and the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicles provide the earliest
reference to this area. Of the various Anglo-
Saxon charters, Merdon is only found in one
relating to Chilcombe. This is a list of lands
taxed with Chilcombe, which is known only
from a 12th century transcript in a register of
St Swithun’s Priory in Winchester.

In spite of the sound foundation for a
Christian society laid down by Birinus and
Cynegils, lapses occurred by a later king and
others. The Chronicles for the year 757 record
how Cynewulf, the West Saxon king, was
caught in a ‘bower’ with his mistress at
Merantun (Merdon), and was murdered by
Cyneheard, brother of Sigeberht, who had
been deposed by Cynewulf. Cynewulf is
interred in Winchester Cathedral in one of
the mortuary chests on the lintels of the side-

screens in the chancel. Except for this brief
mention of a saga of Saxon power struggles,
we have no other information about this
Saxon fort, manor and Village. As with Iron-
Age archaeological remains, subsequent
development of this site will also have
obliterated nearly all Saxon remains. The
next reference to Merdon relates to

the invasion by the Danes over a
hundred years later, which tested

the cohesion of Saxon society under

the leadership of Alfred the Great.

Due to time—wrought spelling
modiﬁcations from Saxon times,
there is sometimes doubt over the
origins of current place names, as
occasionally a Saxon name could ﬁt
more than one present day place
name, but Merdon seems to ﬁt best
these situations on current evidence.

In 871, two months after the Danes
had been victorious at Basing, King
Ethelred and his brother Alfred were
in battle with them at Merdon, and
after a sway of fortunes the Danes
held the place of slaughter. There
were many battles with the Danes
around Winchester resulting in
much bloodshed and loss of life. One
such battle is believed to have taken
place at or near what is now

J ermyn’s Lane at Ampﬁeld, where a
culvert passes under the road, about 0.6 miles
(1 km) beyond Outwood Lodge in Hursley
Park, on the south-western side. This now
innocuous place has the name ‘Bloody Bridge’
as a reminder of the gruesome past.

It is worth noting that the Saxons had

suffered about a century of sporadic and
bloody battles at the hands of the invading
Danes, and England was in a very poor state,
with the only hope of deliverance resting in
the new King Alfred, who had succeeded to
the monarchy after his three elder brothers
had died. Over the winter of 878 Alfred took

refuge at Athelney in Somerset, and by
prayerful and careful planning, he secretly
assembled an army and gained a decisive
victory over the Danes at Edington in
Wiltshire in the early summer of that year. In
this battle everything that could go wrong for
the Danes did, and Alfred’s forces ‘put them
