## The Castle

Of the six castles built by Henry de Blois,
Merdon is the only one not attached to a town
or village. Possibly the shrewd prelate valued
its position as a convenient and strategic
place of retreat for a person and treasury in
those turbulent times, yet a place not worth
the price of siege or assault for its value as a
castle and thus unlikely to be attacked. Its
occupants would have safe shelter until the
turmoil ceased or, at worst, if the castle
should be taken, they could escape to safety
along any of the many back routes available.
Local folklore tells of tunnels leading out of
the castle.

After the Stephen-Matilda wars had ended
and Bishop de Blois had retired to France,
King Henry II ordered the Sheriff of
Hampshire to ‘slight’ the castle. This meant
that the castle’s armaments were removed
and its defensive capacity reduced by
demolition of part of its fabric; on this the
Sheriff spent £6 12s 0d. For the next 800
years the castle served as one of the Bishop of
Winchester’s many palaces.

During this time it was more than just a
residence; many services and functions for
civil and church purposes took place within
its walls. In 1273, Bishop Nicholas of Ely
performed the ceremony of reinstating the
Prior of St. Swithun at Merdon. In 1341
Bishop Adam bestowed the office of Parker (0r
Warrener) on Giles de Mansynton.
