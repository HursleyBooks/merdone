# TUNNELS AT HURSLEY

For over 200 years there have been stories
concerning the existence of tunnels in and
around Hursley Park. Some of these stories

are clearly fanciful, though there is enough
evidence of some real tunnels to see What
could have inspired some of the tales.

Stories of tunnels extending over 200 yards or
metres in length have to be treated with
considerable scepticism, especially when
balanced against both the enormous amount
of excavation work and the associated
problems in maintaining secrecy that would
have been involved.

To date we know about three certain tunnel
systems in the area, and one possible and two
very dubious tales concerning long tunnels,
one of which was said to run from the well at
Merdon Castle to a well in Hursley village,
and the other from the Park House to the
church or one of the houses in the village.

The ﬁrst dubious claim of a tunnel is a nice
piece of folklore about a duck that fell into the
well at Merdon Castle (remember it is about
300 feet (90 m) deep) and turned up in a well
in Hursley village a day or two later minus
some of its feathers — a straight line distance
of over 0.62 miles (1 km)! When the Castle
well was explored in the early part of this
century, no tunnel or anything resembling
such was found, either above or below the
water line, only a great number of pins, an
ashen wood maser bowl and debris.

The second fable concerned a tunnel said to
run from the House to the village, and has
been disproved by all the deep excavation
work between the Park House and the Village.
This would have cut through any such system
but did, in fact, ﬁnd some tunnels that went
absolutely nowhere.

Of the three known tunnel systems, the one
which was by far the most interesting and
puzzling involved a system found when the
footings for C Block were being excavated.

(See illustration on opposite page.) It
consisted of three loops of tunnels linking
together in a triangular form, with the two
larger loops joining into a common gallery 56
feet (17 m) long and furthest in. The ﬂoor
level descended to about 24 feet (7.25 m)
below ground level from the entrance. The
drawing shows passing or possibly defence
bays up to 8 feet (2.5 m) in diameter, and an
average tunnel width of just over 3 feet (1 m),
with a height of 10 feet (3 m).
