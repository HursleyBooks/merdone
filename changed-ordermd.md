# The Changed Order

When the Dowager Lady Cooper moved out of
the House in 1942, to another family home,
the furnishings of the House were either
moved to the family’s other homes or stored
until after the war. The set of seven Beauvais
tapestries were for many years on loan to the
Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
During the years of the Second World War the
English park house and gardens atmosphere
faded and decayed through neglect, although
the House was maintained to a certain extent.

After Vickers moved out to South Marston in
late 1956, the owner of Hursley Park, Captain
Sir George Cooper (the eldest son of the ﬁrst
Sir George Cooper), had the whole site
surveyed for repairs and valuation in 1957.
The changed economic climate made Hursley
Park House too impractical to use as a private
residence again and so the entertainment
hall, now in a ruinous state, was demolished
and the House and site prepared for a new
tenant.

Part of the preparation included, as already
mentioned, giving to Winchester College the
oak panelling attributed to Grinling Gibbons
from the reception and side halls in the
House. This was used in the New Hall at the
College because the panelling, as previously
noted, originally came from the College Chapel.

IBM’s Development Laboratories in the
United Kingdom were formed in London on 1
January 1956. It was always the intention
that the new Laboratories should move out of
London. IBM had bought a piece of land in
North Baddesley, four miles (6 km) south of
Hursley, with the intention of constructing a
purpose-built facility there. In 1958, IBM took
up the lease to house the Laboratories
temporarily in Hursley Park House, until the
North Baddesley facility was ready. In
December 1958, 40 staff and their equipment
moved there in readiness to move to a
purpose-built facility at North Baddesley.
However such was the rate of growth that
Hursley proved to be the better site and, when
the opportunity came to purchase the House
with some 100 acres (40 hectares) in 1961,
after the death of Captain Sir George Cooper,
IBM became the owners of this idyllic site and
built the purpose-designed buildings to the
south east of the House. The North Baddesley
site was never developed.
