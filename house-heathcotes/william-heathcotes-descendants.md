## Sir William Heathcote’s Descendants

Sir William Heathcote, the builder of Hursley
Park House, died in 1751 and his eldest son,
the ﬁrst Sir Thomas Heathcote, inherited the
estate.

Thomas was born in 1721, and is chieﬂy
remembered for his rebuilding of Hursley
church in 1752-3 (and also for building the
family mausoleum in Hursley churchyard).
Only the tower remains from the previous
church - parts of which have been judged to be
Norman. The older church was very dark and
low, with about six steps descending from the
outside to the inner ﬂoor level. The rebuilt
church - of brick quoined in stone (similar to
Hursley Park House) - was welcomed as being
‘neat, light and airy’. This church lasted until
1848.

Sir Thomas married twice and had eight
children. He died in 17 87, and was succeeded
by his eldest son, the second Sir William
Heathcote. Sir William was a much loved and
respected man ‘being the county member in
three parliaments’; he had seven children. His
eldest son, the second Sir Thomas Heathcote
(and fourth baronet of Hursley), inherited the
estate in 1819 and was the MP for the county
from 1808 until 1820 when he retired. This
Sir Thomas added his wife’s name of Freeman
to his own and was generally known as Sir
Thomas Freeman Heathcote. Sir Thomas is
reputed to have been a patron of the arts and
a man of some taste; he extensively altered
Hursley Park House and modernised it around
1821\. However, the younger Sir Thomas was
not remembered with much honour by his
successors because he ‘persuaded his father to
cut off the entail of a great deal of the family
property, and left the Hampshire estates
without an adequate income, and was
eventually the cause of their total loss’ (to the
family).
