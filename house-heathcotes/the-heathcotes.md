## The Heathcotes

The Heathcotes came from Chesterﬁeld in
Derbyshire. The family’s considerable
fortune was accrued by Sir William
Heathcote’s father Samuel, who as a
young man was a merchant in Danzig
(now Gdansk) and Konisberg (now
Kaliningrad) with his brothers. (Samuel’s
eldest brother was lord mayor of London
in 1711, and was the last lord mayor to
ride in procession on horseback.)

After Samuel returned to England, he
married and settled in Chesterﬁeld. He
became a director of the East India
Company and also assisted in work on
regulating the coinage of the realm, the
‘gold standard’ - for which his friend John
Locke was famous. When Samuel died in
1708, his three surviving sons, Gilbert,
William and Samuel inherited his
considerable fortune. Gilbert, the eldest
son, died of smallpox at the age of 18
after which William (the ﬁrst baronet of
Hursley) seems to have acquired most of
his father’s wealth and honours. William
appears to have continued in the family
mercantile business for a while with his
uncles; and in his early twenties, ‘he
