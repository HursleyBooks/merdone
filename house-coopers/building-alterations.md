## The Building alterations

As soon as the purchase had been completed,
the architects Messrs Marshal Mackenzie and
Sons were commissioned to draw up plans for
extending and modernising Hursley Park
House. (Mr A G B Mackenzie was a nephew of
Mr Cooper, and so the choice was not
unexpected.) Almost immediately, the builders
Messrs. Parnell and Sons of Rugby started
work.

At the peak of activity, nearly 400 skilled
workmen were on site. While the building was
in progress, the Coopers used Northend
House in Hursley village, to be near the site
at important times.

Of the people and ﬁrms commissioned for
work on the house, the best known are: Sir
Joseph Duveen (responsible for the ballroom
architecture); Messrs Martin (the woodwork);
Messrs Mallet and Sons (gold and silver
smiths); and Messrs White and Allom (artist
decorators). Of all the ﬁrms and craftsmen
employed, only one group were not English;
they were the company of five gilders who
came over from France, and who left a note
behind the panelling with their names and
the date 24th August 1904.

As previously mentioned, the extensions
involved adding wings to the east and west
ends, a domed conservatory (or winter
garden), a porte—cochere (complete with a
mounting stone to lessen the problems when
mounting a horse) and the garage and coal
store (Block S today). The wings increased the
length of the house to 193 feet (58 m)
excluding the conservatory and extended 107
feet (32 m) from north to south. Every
possible care had been taken to ensure that
the two wings, porte-cochere and
conservatory were in keeping with what was
already a ﬁne country house ~ not only in
style but in materials. Cost, however great,
was no obstacle. Because of the care and
money spent in attempting to match the new
extensions to the older architecture, a study
has to be made of the house before labelling
the centre portion eighteenth century, as the
total effect is so very Edwardian. At this time,
the house was equipped with a coal-ﬁred
central heating system requiring a coal store
of some 100 tons. The coal store and garages
(holding up to eight cars) were built with a
ﬂat roof so that they could hardly be seen
from the house. The house was also equipped
with DC electric lighting; the electric
generators (driven by two Crossley engines)
and accumulators were sited at the Home
Farm.
