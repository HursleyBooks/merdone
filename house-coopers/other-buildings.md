## Other Buildings

In 1908, the entertainment hall was the next
major project to be built. This was situated
behind, and parallel with, the stables (see
plan on page 107), and had a shallow pitched
roof, again so that it could not be seen from
the house. The entrance to the entertainment
hall was from the west end into the vestibule
with cloakrooms each side and a projection
box above. At the opposite end there was a
stage with dressing rooms behind, and a squash
court at the back of the rooms. It was said that
the hall had the best dance ﬂoor for 20 miles
around. The hall also had central heating (the
boiler being underneath with access on the
stable side) and its furnishings were
outstandingly good. Besides using this hall for
private functions, the Coopers made it available
to the village for local functions. Providing
proper notice was given, the hall was prepared,
heated and attended to free of charge. The hall
also had facilities for showing lantern slides
and early movies — thus it was not surprising
that Hursley itself had no village hall.

In 1909, a new laundry was built, replacing
the old one immediately behind the King’s
Head public house in the village. The new
building was erected adjacent to the Home
Farm. Architecturally it is an intriguing
building which demands attention yet does
not seem out of place. The very necessity for
such a laundry building gives a clue to the
scale of life in the big house. Today the
building serves well as the estate ofﬁce.
