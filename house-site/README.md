# Hursley Park House Site 1413-1718

## The 'Logge'
 
The history of buildings on the site of Hursley
Park House seems to have a deﬁnite starting
date of 1413. The Pipe Rolls for that year give
an account for an expense of £8 0s 7d credited
to a carpenter who ‘made a new building
called a logge in the park’. The design of the
logge was geared to hunting, and as such it
lasted for over 100 years. Prior to 1552, the
hunting activities must have dwindled, for in
that year the bishop of Winchester, one John
Poynet, surrendered to King Edward VI the
Merdon estate and other lands around
Winchester. The fact that an established deer
park was part of the Merdon estate must
have added enormously to its value.

A conjectured plan of this ﬁrst building on the
site of Hursley Park House surmises that it
had two/three main rooms facing south, with a
butchery and pantry/kitchens at one end
under an extension of the thatched roof
reaching down to the ground. Behind the
three principal rooms would have been the
stables, probably with open access to the
north side, with an entrance through to the
domestic quarters. The thatched roof over the
whole building would have doubled as a hay
loft and sleeping quarters for the farrier,
groom, and any servants. A building larger
than this would have exceeded the recorded
building costs. The exact site of the logge is
not completely certain. However, pictorial
evidence and the position of a well suggest
that it could have stood in the area of the
present well house and bothy (a small cottage
to house estate workers, T Block today).
