## The 28th Division

Although there is no tablet to record the
partial assembly in Hursley Park of the 28th
Division in December 1914 and January 1915,
this Division did assemble and mobilise at
Hursley, Pitt Hill, and Magdalen Hill Camps
around Winchester.

Like the 8th Division, the 28th was chieﬂy
formed of units drawn from overseas stations,
and was one of the last three regular divisions
assembled for service in the Great War. Ten
units came from India, and one each came
from Egypt and Singapore. The cavalry and
yeomanry units were assembled in this
country.

Hursley Park was host to the 83rd and 84th
Infantry Brigades during December 1914,
where they were issued with new equipment,
stores of all kinds and transport. Following so
quickly the assembly of the 8th Division,
Hursley Park must have been in no condition
to withstand the mobilisation of another
12,000 men and the dispersal this time to
three camps can be understood. Frosty
weather (which must have been miserable for
the troops from India and other hot climes)
ended on 28 December with violent storms.
These blew down and tore the tents, and
conditions deteriorated so much that all
troops were ordered to leave Hursley Park on
1 January 1915 for accommodation in billets
in Winchester College Houses, which afforded
a very comfortable change for all ranks.

On 12 January 1915, the 28th Division was
inspected by His Majesty King George V on
Fawley Down, which is to the east of Winchester
two to three miles out on the southern side of
the Petersﬁeld Road. On 15 January, starting at
8.00 am, the Division left for Southampton, and
upon embarking received a personal copy of a
message from the King.

*Composition of the 28th Division January 1915*


While the 8th Division served on the Western
Front in France for the whole war, the 28th
Division was only there for some nine months,
ﬁrst joining V Corps, Second Army, engaging in
the second battle of Ypres at Gravenstafel
Ridge, St Julien, Frezenberg Ridge, Bellewaade
Ridge and with I Corps, First Army at Loos. In
November 1915 the Division arrived in Egypt
and moved to Salonica in Turkey. By January
1916 they had fought alongside the XVI Corps
at Mazirko and Bairakli Jum’a. In 1917 they
captured Ferdie and the Essex Trenches, also
Bairakli and Komli, and were still with the XVI
at the Battle of Dojran and the pursuit to the
Strumica Valley with the XII Corps in 1918.
The Division stayed in Turkey until returning
home and disbanding in 1923.

Today, the only evidence in the Park of the visit
of these troops is the many initials carved on
trees and the occasional piece of broken cast
iron water pipe that is ploughed up. The ground
has also yielded many military buttons,
cartridge cases, coins and other artefacts of this
period which are easily lost from pockets and
person, and no doubt the wider Park will
continue to reveal lost items from this period
when trees are uprooted or the rain washes the
dirt off artefacts after ploughing.
