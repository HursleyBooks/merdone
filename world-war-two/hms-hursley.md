## HMS Hursley

The Royal Navy connection with Hursley was
purely in the name, which was used
appropriately for a ‘Hunt Class’ Destroyer, HMS
Hursley. Appropriately the link here is with the
Hursley Hunt, and also Hursley begins with an
‘H’. The ﬁrst ship of the series was called HMS
Hunt. When the Admiralty ran out of place
names beginning with ‘H’ (and they included
Havant with HMS Havant), they went on to
other place names associated with a Hunt such
as Cattistock in Dorset.

HMS Hursley was a typical hard-working
wartime destroyer in the Royal Navy, with a
short but very creditable war service record.
Built by Swan Hunter at Wallsend on Tyne in
1941 and commissioned in 1942, she had a
full complement of 168 men, commanded by
Lt. Cmdr. W J P Church. The photograph
shows HMS Hursley in about 1942 when she
had just been commissioned for naval service
and was either completing or had just completed
her sea trials from Swan Hunter’s yard.

Four different versions of the Hunt Class
destroyers were built during the war, and a total
of 86 were completed in all. Of these work-
horses of the ﬂeet, 23 were lost as a result of
enemy action. One of these was HMS Havant,
which was sunk by enemy aircraft during the
evacuation of Dunkirk. After the war, 13 of the
Hunts were transferred to foreign navies and re-
commissioned with new names.

The Hunt Class destroyers were of necessity
utility ships, built to a minimum standard to
satisfy the urgent need for destroyers in
World War II. It is interesting to note that the
early versions built up to the end of 1940 had
a range of only 2,000 nautical miles and,
owing to their limited fuel capacity, were
unable to make an Atlantic crossing. HMS
Hursley, however, belonged to the improved
second generation of Hunt Class vessels with
a range of 3,600 nautical miles, and was quite
fast for the time with a maximum speed of 27
knots. It appears that HMS Hursley
performed all her wartime service in the
Mediterranean zone, where she very soon
made a name for herself, taking part in action
off Benghazi in Libya, and was later involved
in support operations in the Aegean Sea.

After the war, HMS Hursley was transferred
to the Greek navy, and sailed under the name
‘Kriti’ (Crete). She was seen in Valetta
harbour Malta, in 1953/54, and was ﬁnally
scrapped in 1960.
