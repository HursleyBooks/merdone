## A New Home for the Spitﬁre Design Team

As in the First World War, the now Dowager
Lady Cooper offered Hursley Park House for
use as a hospital, but this offer appears to
have coincided with a requisition placed on
the Park by Lord Beaverbrook, the then
Minister for Aircraft Production. After his
order to disperse Vickers operations was
made, he issued an edict for the immediate
requisition of the fourth floor of the Polygon
Hotel in Southampton to accommodate the
executives of the company. The design team
was housed at Southampton University until
they were again ﬁrebombed out of these
ofﬁces. In December 1940, they were all
moved to Hursley House, which formed a
suitable self-contained area for the
Supermarine administration.

Although a number of Lord Beaverbrook’s
personal staff moved down from London to
assist in the whole complex operation, which
spread over many counties (with
manufacturing and assembly of Spitﬁres
around Eastleigh, a new factory at Castle
Bromwich, and facilities at Newbury,
Reading, Salisbury, Southampton,
Trowbridge, Winchester, and the Westland
Aircraft factory at Yeovil), it was really Len
Gooch, then aged 30, and some able
administrators who were the driving force
behind the expansion and production of
Spitﬁres at that critical time. Lady Cooper, in
spite of having her offer countered by the
requisition order, and obviously feeling
overtaken by events and their overwhelming
impact on her stately home, with nearly all
control this time out of her hands, graciously
welcomed her new guests with a spectacular
ﬂoral model of the Spitﬁre in the entrance
hall of the House. The accommodation of the
design and administration staff required the
storage of most of the furnishings, paintings
and fabric that made up this country mansion.
For a time Lady Cooper continued to live on
the ﬁrst and top ﬂoors of the House, and was
supported by a few staff. The staff were also
useful to Vickers until June 1942, when it
became impractical from a security standpoint
to continue with this arrangement, as the
following account shows.

On 19 June, several of the Supermarine staff
returned from a cricket match and were
surprised to discover ﬁre engines in
attendance outside the House. It transpired
that Mr Grove the butler, being short staffed,
had taken on a casual assistant cook, who was
tempted by an opportunity to steal the family
silver stored in a safe in the basement. His
aim was to start a ﬁre on the top ﬂoor above
Lady Cooper’s bedroom, to divert attention
away from the scene of his nefarious deed. His
plans went awry due to the substantial
reinforced concrete between the ﬂoors, and he
was somehow overcome by the smoke from his
own decoy ﬁre. After investigation by the
Police, a bicycle went missing from the village
several days later, and the man was not seen
here again.

This incident highlighted the problem of
security, and Lady Cooper, together with her
staff, moved out to Merdon Manor Farm, little
knowing that she was ending two hundred
and twenty years of private residential use for
Hursley House. A former C.I.D. ofﬁcer from
Scotland Yard, a Mr Wakeling, was taken on
as security ofﬁcer, and is remembered for
always wearing a black suit and black
homburg hat which he was never known to
remove.

Evidently Scotland Yard considered their men
improperly dressed if the hat was removed.
This custom dated back many years and
helped cultivate the stereotype image of a,
Scotland Yard detective. For a time he lived in
one of the cottages that made up the bothy by
the stables, and had his ofﬁce at the top of the
House. From this time Vickers Supermarine
completely occupied the House, stables and
cottages, and started the building of the two
large hangars. The one to the east of the
House was the drawing ofﬁce, known later to
IBM as X Block (demolished in 1994) and the
other, adjacent to Southampton Lodge, was
the experimental hangar. (This was
demolished in 1986.)

Initially around ﬁfty people came to Hursley,
soon to swell to several hundred as others
were recruited from all parts of the country
for their various skills and abilities suitable
for experimental factory work. A fairly large
group of printing operators were conscripted
from the Bournemouth area, as were workers
from the Midlands and North of England.
There were solicitors, professional footballers,
novelists, and retailers in this very mixed
bunch. The few with manufacturing
experience and skills in all—metal aircraft were
made chargehands or foremen to train and
educate the rest in the latest technology. The
hours at work were long — in excess of eighty
hours a week were often the case. If
individuals were persistently late or absent
from work, they would be hauled before a
tribunal to account for their behaviour, and
could be prosecuted and called up for service.
One young man served a month in Winchester
Prison, before being immediately conscripted
to the Air Force. A number of workers were
‘dereserved’ and Within days found themselves
in uniform. Some preferred this to factory life
to which they could not adapt.

Mr Wakeling is also remembered by some of
the senior executives for organising a trip to
London to sample some of the night life, of
which he seemed to have expert knowledge.
The unorthodox methods he used to gain
entrance to'some of the clubs were an eye
opener to those otherwise unblemished lives
who had never experienced such goings-on. He
also kept an eagle eye on those members of
the design staff who raided the walnut trees
in the Park, until some of the staff who were
working through the night found him
collecting walnuts in his famous homburg - an
incident he was not allowed to forget. The
design staff generally considered Wakeling to
be under employed, and invented cases for
him from time to time. One of his longest was
investigating the theft of Joe Smith’s
imaginary bicycle.

Most of the Supermarine staff were bussed
into Hursley Park each morning and home
again in the evening. The bus rides are
remembered with measures of enjoyment and
trepidation. Some of the Supermarine folk
acted as conductors, and each bus had its
card—playing contingent on the top deck. In
the early days, Hursley Coaches, owned by the
Jones family, had the contract to bus in
Vickers staff, and one of the Jones brothers is
remembered for taking his hands off the
steering wheel to unwrap a sweet slowly and
methodically before putting it in his mouth.

Later, staff numbers increased and local bus
companies had to be brought in to assist with
the extra numbers. The drivers, used to more
normal stop and go routines to match the bus
stops, had to adjust to a 16 mile non-stop trip.
There were often two buses running neck and
neck up the Chandler’s Ford Road to try to get
to the ‘S’ bend ﬁrst. By contrast, there were
