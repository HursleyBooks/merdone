# Hursley Park during World War II and Vickers 1939 - 1956

## A Temporary Home for Many

When a state of war was declared between
Britain and Germany on 3 September 1939,
the use of Hursley Park and its amenities
was, as in the First World War, offered to the
country. Very soon the wooded parts of the
Park accommodated a tented transit camp
that capitalised. on the camouﬂage provided
by the mature trees. The camp was formed to
handle some of the considerable number of
overseas volunteers who had enlisted to serve
with the British Armed Forces and ﬁght the
common foe. The men had to be carefully
screened and sent on to appropriate units to
help the overall war effort. Americans,
Belgians, Canadians, Free French and Poles
were among those identiﬁed who, when time
allowed during their short stay in the Park,
added a little to village life. The Poles showed
a love for children, and used a raft they built
as an exercise on the Park lake for giving
rides to excited local children. Later, the camp
handled a lot of those rescued from the great
Dunkirk evacuation. Besides British troops,
there were also Free French, Poles and other
Europeans.

After an exciting voyage with other children
on the Polish raft, one little girl took home a
pheasant’s egg she found near the lake to her
horriﬁed grandfather, who took it down the
garden, broke it and buried it. It was an
indictable offence to interfere with game in
this way, even during the war, and this poor
man feared the worst of all outcomes from this
innocent act. These inhibitions were not
shared by everyone, as game of every sort was
stealthily despatched to local larders to eke
out the meagre wartime rations for domestic,
trade and service people alike, right through
the war. This could explain why riﬂe practices
took place in the early morning or late
evening, though getting men used to combat
conditions in the half—light was just about
plausible, until you saw the amount of game
that happened to get in the way of rather too
many bullets. Even after the war, the present
title holder of the Hursley Heathcotes, while
at Winchester College, took advantage of his
family connections and cycled over to Hursley
Park and caught rabbits to augment his
inadequate college rations.

In 1939 the Park had a very good game
reserve, with a herd of deer, game birds, and
various animals. When wartime restrictions
on feed came in, the herd had to be culled, and
early in 1941 the Vickers Supermarine design
staff, who were located in the Ballroom, were
startled one morning by shots ringing out
across the driveway. From the windows they
saw a member of the Cooper family
supervising some of the remaining estate
workers in reducing the herd. This was a sad
sight for the folk from towns not used to
country ways, but there was a palliative
sequel when they were the recipients of
venison lunches soon afterwards.

During the war the Park, being convenient for
Southampton Docks, was a temporary home
for many service men travelling to and from
overseas, and for men simply en route across
southern England. Many thousands must
have had brief stays under canvas in the
Park. Of all the visitors, the Americans, with
their large and more comfortable camp of
wooden huts in the Merdon Castle area,
outnumbered the rest. Such was the
effectiveness of the war effort, they made up
in one day the road that now forms the
beginning of the Slackstead and Farley
Chamberlain Road. Because of the dispersal of
the huts under the tall trees, the site appears
to have occupied many acres, and was a
transit camp and ﬁeld stores which played an
important part in the preparation for the
Normandy landings (D-Day). There were
about a hundred huts in the camp making
quite a contrast to the old Castle. Depending
on the season, some were visible from Hursley
House. The camp existed from about 1943
until just after the end of the war.

The recreational activities and visible life
style of the camp came as a cultural shock to
Hursley residents at the time. There were
jokes about ‘just who is our real enemy?’
Certainly the number of camp followers
rounded up by the Police in the mornings, was
an unedifying experience for what was
generally a God-fearing village. In a bid to be
accepted as being something more than a
mixed blessing to the village, the Americans
added much to village life, especially at
Christmas time with parties for the village
and estate people. One such Christmas party
was aided by a guitar-playing American
cowboy who added to the fun, but had to be
virtually pulled off the stage to allow other
acts to follow and the party to continue. As
public relations exercises go, it was quite
successful, and for many these American
events became something to look forward to.
This was the time when many of the Vickers
Supermarine staff were smoking American
cigarettes, exchanged across the fence for beer
money.

The D-Day preparations by the Americans
here were extensive. Many local roads were
closed to the public, and roads around Hursley
were made single lane in places, because
tanks, jeeps, and support vehicles, waiting to
depart for the docks, were parked under any
overhanging trees. The part of the Romsey
Road known as the Straight Mile, between
Ampﬁeld and Crampmoor, was totally closed
to any trafﬁc. This allowed vehicles to be
hidden from the air by the very effective
canopy of mature trees over both lanes. The
American servicemen were known to have
driven lorries from the camp at all hours,
right round the clock, to and from
Southampton and Portsmouth Docks. Their
efforts in taking laden lorries down, and
bringing empty ones back, are still
remembered by those who lived on the routes.

The American visitors were blessed in having
generous food parcels sent from home and are
remembered for sharing out their surplus
rations with the villagers when they left.
Anything on wheels was brought into service
to move this very welcome, out-of-season
harvest festival bonanza. These are the type
of memories that surface ﬁfty years after the
event, which fortunately displace the many
very sad ones.

Certainly Hursley Park was a very real
experience for many thousands of servicemen
during the war, and must today still be
remembered for one reason or another by
many all round the world. The organisation of
the American camp allowed troops such as the
4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards to prepare in a
very orderly way with no last minute rush or
wild panic. The camp was run on what was
called ‘the hotel system’, which meant that all
the administration, cooking and fatigues were
done by a permanent staff, leaving the D-Day
personnel to concentrate on the ﬁnishing
touches and brieﬁngs for the great liberation — a
rare thing in the history of the British Army,
where the form was generally muddling through
and winning the last battle.

Some months after D-Day when the camp had
been vacated, a few of the Vickers staff walked
the kilometre from Hursley House across the
ﬁelds to the empty camp and found on the walls
inside the huts some quite beautiful landscape
and other paintings. So amongst these service
men there had been some talented artists, and
it is a pity that no photographic records were
kept of these short lived works of art.

Considering the close proximity of Vickers’
design ofﬁces in Hursley House to Merdon
Castle, it is surprising to ﬁnd that some of the
‘D-Day’ huts there became a small prisoner-of-
war camp towards the end of the war. We
assume this was for low risk prisoners, because
many of the Vickers’ staff remember playing in
football matches against the inmates in the
Park. On the other hand this could have been a
ploy to lead the inmates to believe little of
consequence went on at the ‘big house’.

As just a small country village away from
Southampton, Hursley was spared the
destruction from bombs, V1 Flying Bombs
(doodle-bugs), and V2 rockets, and for this, some
credit should go to the security and air raid
precautions taken, especially in the Park. In
spite of the secrecy surrounding the recovery of
a German propaganda container which fell near
the church one morning, failing to open properly
and distribute its contents, a number of Vickers
Supermarine staff did get hold of many of the
leaﬂets and had a good laugh at the crude
propaganda.

There were two aircraft crashes in the Park
during these war years. On one Saturday four
or ﬁve US. Army personnel took off for a joy
ride in a light American spotter plane from
Hursley Park towards Ampﬁeld. The plane
was grossly overloaded, and came down in a
wooded section of the Park east of Knapp at
Ampﬁeld, killing all the occupants. The speed
of the recovery of the wreckage by the
Americans from Hursley Camp led to the
usual crop of rumours that the plane was on
the secret list. The fact that Spitﬁre engines
were run up and tested in and around the
experimental hangar at Southampton Lodge
probably did nothing to dispel this rumour in
those hush-hush war years. Small planes,
properly loaded, could safely take off and land,
but the combination of a small, overloaded
plane and over-spirited men made this an
accident impatient to happen. The other
accident was a crash landing north of Hursley
House by a Swordﬁsh aircraft, piloted by the
actor Ralph Richardson. The aircraft had to be
disassembled, removed on a Queen Mary
transporter and taken back to Eastleigh
airport, from where it had taken-off. The fact
that Ralph Richardson (later Sir Ralph
Richardson) crash-landed and survived added
more to his personal standing and kudos in
this area than any of his acting performances
could possibly have done. (A Queen Mary
transporter was a very long and low
articulated open transporter, with just two
large independently sprung wheels at the
back, pulled by a conventional lorry style
tractor. Its unfamiliar length was likened to
the famous Queen Mary ocean liner of the
time.)
